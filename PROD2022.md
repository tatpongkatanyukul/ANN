## Log

### July 12th, 2022.
  * [Continue trying Nvidia SSD](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD#getting-the-data)
    * Quick Start Guide section: run ```docker build . -t nvidia_ssd```
      * ```-t``` is "Name and optionally a tag in the 'name:tag' format" ([from docker doc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/))
      * It takes very long time to run this command: reach 
      * [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/blob/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD/Dockerfile) and [requirements.txt](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/blob/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD/requirements.txt)
      * retry again with ```nohup docker build . -t nvidia_ssd1 &```
        * TO DO: remove ```nvidia_ssd```, which may be incomplete, since I press <ctrl>+C while on ```COPY . .```

### July 13th, 2022
  * Command ```nohup docker build . -t nvidia_ssd1 &``` does not seem to work. The process has been stopped, but no ```nvidia_ssd1``` has been created.
  * Rename old half-baked image to ```nvidia_ssd0``` and try to finish up the ```COPY . .```
    * ```docker run --rm -it --gpus=all --ipc=host -v ~/2022/nvidia_examples/PyTorch/Detection:/Detection nvidia_ssd0```
    * ```cd /workspace/ssd``` then ```cp /Detection/* .```
    * Folders did not get copied over. 
      * Fix with ```cp -r /Detection/SSD/COCO .```
      * Fix with ```cp -r /Detection/SSD/dle .```
      * Fix with ```cp -r /Detection/SSD/examples .``` 
      * Fix with ```cp -r /Detection/SSD/img .```    
      * Fix with ```cp -r /Detection/SSD/ssd .```    
    * I forgot that it is not persistent.
 * Commit container of ```nvidia_ssd0``` to ```nvidia_ssd1```, then copy files over.
   * On ```Detection/SSD```, run ```docker cp . <container id>:/workspace/ssd```
     * Note: <container id> has to be **containter id**. It cannot be image name. Otherwise, it will give "no such container!".
   * Finally, once files are copied over, don't forget to **commit** a container to an image.

 * TO DO:
   * Test docker image ```nvidia_ssd``` (once it is good, remove older images: ```nvidia_ssd0```, ```nvidia_ssd1```)
   * In ```/workspace/ssd``` of the container, test training: 
     * ```bash ./examples/SSD300_FP16_8GPU.sh . ./COCO --save ./SSD_CHECKPOINT```
     * where ```SSD_CHECKPOINT``` has been created under ```/workspace/ssd```.
     * Result:
       * ```RuntimeError: CUDA error: invalid device ordinal```
   * test inference:
     * Steps 6-8 under [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD#quick-start-guide)
