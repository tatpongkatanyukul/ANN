# Progress in 2022
The teaching has never been better
* Numerical computation
* ANN formulation
* Backpropagation
* Vectorization computation
* Textbook reading
* Paper reading
* Keras/CNN examples
* Object detection examples

Evaluation has never been worst

What it lacks
* Exercises
  * Exercises in ANN development and ANN applications
